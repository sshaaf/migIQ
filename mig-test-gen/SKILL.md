# Graph-Driven Test Generation

This skill generates comprehensive test suites using rgctl's knowledge graph to intelligently prioritize which code needs the most testing. By analyzing PageRank, blast-radius, and call-graph connectivity, it focuses testing effort where it matters most: architectural hotspots, public APIs, and critical integration points.

## Prerequisites

**Prerequisite:** Codebase indexed via **mig-rgctl** ([workflow](../mig-rgctl/references/workflow.md#mig-test-gen--mig-deploy)).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Generate tests for an existing codebase (especially legacy code)
- Add test coverage before a migration or major refactoring
- Create characterization tests to lock down current behavior
- Fill test coverage gaps identified during code review
- Ensure critical code paths are well-tested

The graph-driven approach ensures you test what matters, not just hit arbitrary coverage percentages.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Ensure rgctl Index and Communities Exist

```bash
rgctl -f json metrics --pagerank
rgctl -f json communities list
```

If either fails, invoke **mig-rgctl**, run discover per [workflow](../mig-rgctl/references/workflow.md), then STOP.

### Step 2: Analyze Graph to Identify Critical Code

Query the graph to understand what needs testing:

```bash
# Architectural hotspots (Priority 1 test targets)
rgctl -f json metrics --pagerank --communities

# Community boundaries for integration tests
rgctl -f json communities list
```

Look for:
- **PageRank top symbols** — These are your Priority 1 test targets (high connectivity)
- **Communities** — Helps identify integration test boundaries
- **High blast-radius symbols** — Edge cases and ripple-effect paths that need coverage

Extract callers/callees for a symbol:
```bash
rgctl -f json gql "MATCH (a:Function)-[:CALLS]->(b:Function) WHERE b.name = 'ClassName' RETURN a,b LIMIT 20"
```

### Step 3: Categorize Code by Test Priority

Based on graph analysis, categorize all classes/modules into priority tiers:

**Priority 1 - God Nodes (degree ≥ 10):**
- These are the most-connected classes that many others depend on
- Changes here ripple through the entire codebase
- **Coverage requirement:** 90%+
- **Test type:** Comprehensive characterization tests
- **Test weight:** 3× (generate 3× more tests than normal)

**Priority 2 - Public APIs (Controllers, Services, REST endpoints):**
- External-facing code that other systems depend on
- Breaking changes here affect users/clients
- **Coverage requirement:** 95%+
- **Test type:** Functional tests + contract tests
- **Test weight:** 2.5×

**Priority 3 - Hubs (degree 5-9):**
- Important integration points with moderate connectivity
- **Coverage requirement:** 85%+
- **Test type:** Standard unit + integration tests
- **Test weight:** 2×

**Priority 4 - Normal nodes (degree 2-4):**
- Regular classes with standard dependencies
- **Coverage requirement:** 75%+
- **Test type:** Basic unit tests
- **Test weight:** 1×

**Priority 5 - Leaf nodes (degree 0-1):**
- Isolated utilities or data classes with minimal dependencies
- **Coverage requirement:** 70%+
- **Test type:** Minimal unit tests
- **Test weight:** 0.5×

### Step 4: Generate Tests by Priority

Work through the priority tiers from highest to lowest.

**For each class to test:**

1. **Determine dependencies from graph:**
   ```bash
   rgctl -f json gql "MATCH (a:Function)-[:CALLS]->(b:Function) WHERE a.name = 'ClassName' RETURN a,b LIMIT 20"
   # Know what to mock
   ```

2. **Read the actual class implementation:**
   ```bash
   # Only NOW read the source file
   # Use Read tool to get method signatures and behavior
   ```

3. **Check for existing tests:**
   ```bash
   find . -name "*Test.java" -o -name "*Test.py" -o -name "*.test.js" | xargs grep -l "ClassName"
   # Avoid duplicating existing tests
   ```

4. **Generate tests based on priority tier:**

   **For God Nodes (Priority 1):**
   - Test every public method
   - Test edge cases and error handling
   - Test integration with top 3 dependencies
   - Add parametrized tests for data-driven scenarios
   - Include performance tests if relevant

   **For Public APIs (Priority 2):**
   - Test all API endpoints/public methods
   - Test request/response contracts
   - Test error responses (400, 401, 404, 500)
   - Test authentication/authorization
   - Add integration tests for full request flows

   **For Hubs (Priority 3):**
   - Test main public methods
   - Test integration with key dependencies
   - Basic error handling

   **For Normal/Leaf (Priority 4-5):**
   - Test primary use cases
   - Basic happy path coverage

### Step 5: Use Graph Paths for Integration Tests

For integration tests, use the graph to understand end-to-end flows:

```bash
rgctl -f json gql "MATCH (n:Function) WHERE n.name LIKE '*Controller' RETURN n LIMIT 50"
# Find all controllers (entry points)
```

For each controller, trace the dependency path:
```bash
rgctl -f json gql "MATCH (a:Function)-[:CALLS*1..3]->(b:Function) WHERE a.name = 'UserController' RETURN a,b LIMIT 50"
# Example: UserController → UserService → UserRepository
```

Generate integration tests that follow these paths:
- Test the full request → controller → service → repository → DB flow
- Mock only external dependencies (database, external APIs)
- Keep internal dependencies real to test actual integration

### Step 6: Calculate and Report Test Coverage

After generating tests, calculate weighted coverage:

```bash
# Run test coverage tool (language-specific)
# Java: mvn test jacoco:report
# Python: pytest --cov
# JavaScript: npm test -- --coverage
```

For each priority tier, check if coverage meets requirements:
- God nodes: 90%+ ✓/✗
- Public APIs: 95%+ ✓/✗
- Hubs: 85%+ ✓/✗
- Normal: 75%+ ✓/✗
- Leaves: 70%+ ✓/✗

**Weighted coverage score:**
```
Total Coverage = (
  (God_Node_Coverage × 3) +
  (Public_API_Coverage × 2.5) +
  (Hub_Coverage × 2) +
  (Normal_Coverage × 1) +
  (Leaf_Coverage × 0.5)
) / Total_Weight
```

This ensures critical code is weighted appropriately.

## Test Generation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Characterization Tests (God Nodes)

**Goal:** Lock down existing behavior before refactoring

```java
// Example for a god node class
@Test
public void testUserService_existingBehavior() {
    // Arrange: Set up exact current state
    UserService service = new UserService();
    
    // Act: Call method with known inputs
    User result = service.getUser(123L);
    
    // Assert: Verify current behavior (even if wrong)
    assertEquals("currentBehavior", result.getStatus());
    // Document: Add comment if behavior seems wrong
    // TODO: This returns "currentBehavior" but should probably return "active"
}
```

**Why:** For legacy code migrations, you need to preserve existing behavior (bugs and all) until you understand what's intentional.

### Pattern 2: Contract Tests (Public APIs)

**Goal:** Ensure API contracts don't break

```java
@Test
public void testGetUser_returnsCorrectSchema() {
    Response response = api.getUser(123L);
    
    assertEquals(200, response.getStatus());
    assertTrue(response.hasField("id"));
    assertTrue(response.hasField("username"));
    assertTrue(response.hasField("email"));
    // Validate exact schema
}
```

**Why:** During migration, you're likely changing implementation but need to maintain API compatibility.

### Pattern 3: Dependency Integration Tests (Hubs)

**Goal:** Test real integration between components

```java
@Test
public void testUserService_integratesWithRepository() {
    // Use REAL repository, mock only DB
    UserRepository repo = new UserRepository(mockDatabase);
    UserService service = new UserService(repo);
    
    service.createUser(newUser);
    
    verify(mockDatabase).insert(any());
    // Tests real service → repository integration
}
```

**Why:** The graph shows these classes work together - test the actual integration, not just mocked interactions.

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Java (Spring Boot)

**Unit Test Pattern:**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class UserServiceTest {
    @Mock private UserRepository repository;
    @InjectMocks private UserService service;
    
    @Test
    void testGetUser_whenExists_returnsUser() {
        when(repository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(testUser));
        User result = service.getUser(1L);
        assertNotNull(result);
    }
}
```

**Integration Test Pattern:**
```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class UserControllerIntegrationTest {
    @Autowired private MockMvc mvc;
    
    @Test
    void testGetUser_endToEnd() throws Exception {
        mvc.perform(get("/api/users/1"))
           .andExpect(status().isOk())
           .andExpect(jsonPath("$.username").exists());
    }
}
```

### Python (Django/pytest)

**Unit Test Pattern:**
```python
from unittest.mock import Mock
import pytest

class TestUserService:
    def test_get_user_when_exists_returns_user(self):
        mock_repo = Mock()
        mock_repo.find_by_id.return_value = test_user
        
        service = UserService(mock_repo)
        result = service.get_user(1)
        
        assert result is not None
```

**Integration Test Pattern:**
```python
@pytest.mark.django_db
class TestUserAPI:
    def test_get_user_endpoint(self, client):
        user = User.objects.create(username="test")
        
        response = client.get(f'/api/users/{user.id}/')
        
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json()['username'] == 'test'
```

### JavaScript (Node.js/Jest)

**Unit Test Pattern:**
```javascript
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should get user when exists', async () => {
    const mockRepo = { findById: jest.fn().resolves(testUser) };
    const service = new UserService(mockRepo);
    
    const result = await service.getUser(1);
    
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

**Integration Test Pattern:**
```javascript
describe('User API', () => {
  it('GET /api/users/:id returns user', async () => {
    const user = await User.create({ username: 'test' });
    
    const response = await request(app).get(`/api/users/${user.id}`);
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body.username).toBe('test');
  });
});
```

## Output Format

Generate a test suite report showing:

```markdown
# Test Suite Generation Report

## Summary
- **Total classes analyzed:** [count from graph]
- **Tests generated:** [count]
- **Estimated coverage:** [percentage]
- **Priority breakdown:**
  - God nodes: [count] classes → [count] tests
  - Public APIs: [count] classes → [count] tests
  - Hubs: [count] classes → [count] tests
  - Normal/Leaf: [count] classes → [count] tests

## Priority 1: God Nodes
### [ClassName] (degree: [N])
- **Location:** [file path]
- **Tests generated:** [count]
- **Coverage target:** 90%+
- **Test files created:**
  - `[TestFileName]` - [brief description]

## Priority 2: Public APIs
[Same structure]

## Priority 3: Hubs
[Same structure]

## Priority 4: Normal/Leaf
[Summary only - don't list every class]

## Coverage Report
| Priority | Classes | Tests | Target | Actual | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| God Nodes | [N] | [N] | 90%+ | [%] | ✓/✗ |
| Public APIs | [N] | [N] | 95%+ | [%] | ✓/✗ |
| Hubs | [N] | [N] | 85%+ | [%] | ✓/✗ |
| Normal/Leaf | [N] | [N] | 70-75%+ | [%] | ✓/✗ |

**Weighted Coverage Score:** [percentage]

## Next Steps
1. Review generated tests for [ClassName] (highest priority god node)
2. Run test suite to verify all tests pass
3. Adjust coverage for any failing priority tier
4. Consider additional integration tests for [specific paths]
```

## Key Principles

**Graph-First, Not Coverage-First:**
Don't chase arbitrary coverage percentages. Use the graph to identify what's critical, then test that thoroughly. 70% coverage on god nodes is better than 95% coverage on leaf nodes.

**Minimize File Reads:**
The graph tells you what to test and what it depends on. Only read source files to understand method signatures and implementation details. Target: <5 file reads per class tested.

**Prioritize Ruthlessly:**
If you only have time for 20 tests, generate all 20 for god nodes. Don't spread them evenly across the codebase.

**Test Actual Integration:**
When the graph shows ClassA → ClassB, test that real integration, not just mocked calls. The graph reveals actual dependencies.

**Explain Coverage Gaps:**
If a god node only hits 70% coverage (below 90% target), explain why in the report. Maybe certain methods are deprecated or impossible to test. Don't force it.

**Use Graph Paths for Integration Tests:**
```
Controller → Service → Repository → Database
```
This path (from the graph) becomes one integration test. Test the whole flow.

Remember: The knowledge graph is your test strategy. High-degree nodes = high test priority. Low-degree nodes = minimal tests. Simple as that.
